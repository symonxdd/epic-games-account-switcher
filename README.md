## 💡 Good to know

The current installation does not include the required .NET runtime (version 8 or higher). If the runtime is not already installed on your system, Epic Switcher will prompt you upon launch and provide a direct link to the latest official download for quick and easy installation.

➡️ *A future release is planned to include a version with the packaged runtime for added convenience.*
